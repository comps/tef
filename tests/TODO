  - unset prefix
  - empty prefix
  - normal prefix

  # these are out of spec, but we should check them anyway

  - status into non-terminal
  - status into terminal (ttee)

- ptef_mklog
  - unset prefix
  - empty prefix
  - normal prefix

  - empty testname

  - ptef_logs undefined
    - check for 'logs'
  - ptef_logs absolute
    - check for log dir + file
  - ptef_logs relative
    - check for log dir + file

  - log rotation .log to .log.1
